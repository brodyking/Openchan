<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="static/example.gif" style="width: 100%">

There are many imageboard scripts out there for anyone to use, so why this one? Well there is not really a reason. If you like a simplier layout and a more textboard style website that also supports images, then this script is for you! But I still would not reccomend anyone use this script yet. There are a few things that have not been done to make this secure yet. I will talk about it later in this readme.

### Built With

Usually, this part of the readme would be really big... But not this time! This entire project was written in PHP, so there are no dependencies.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

Just clone the repository and start up your PHP server. The PHP used is very basic so almost all versions should work.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To create a new board, just copy the /b/ folder and change the folder name and $bn variable inside of /boardname/index.php. All posts are stored in a database.html file for each board and and images are stored in the /boardname/data/ folder.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Add MOAR CSS
- [x] Allow Image Uploading
- [ ] Make it so you cant post <script> inside of your post body
- [ ] Add formatting for greentext and bold. Currently you can use HTML, which is insecure.
