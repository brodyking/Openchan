<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="static/example.gif" style="width: 100%">

There are many imageboard scripts out there for anyone to use, so why this one? Well there is not really a reason. If you like a simplier layout and a more textboard style website that also supports images, then this script is for you! But I still would not reccomend anyone use this script yet. There are a few things that have not been done to make this secure yet. I will talk about it later in this readme.

### Built With

Usually, this part of the readme would be really big... But not this time! This entire project was written in PHP, so there are no dependencies.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To create a new board, just copy the /b/ folder and change the folder name and $bn variable inside of /boardname/index.php. All posts are stored in a database.html file for each board and and images are stored in the /boardname/data/ folder.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
